    abstract = {The prosperity of location-based social networking has paved the way for new applications of group-based activity planning and marketing. While such applications heavily rely on geo-social group queries (GSGQs), existing studies fail to produce a cohesive group in terms of user acquaintance. In this paper, we propose a new family of GSGQs with minimum acquaintance constraints. They are more appealing to users as they guarantee a worst-case acquaintance level in the result group. For efficient processing of GSGQs on large location-based social networks, we devise two social-aware spatial index structures, namely SaR-tree and SaR*-tree. The latter improves on the former by considering both spatial and social distances when clustering objects. Based on SaR-tree and SaR*-tree, novel algorithms are developed to process various GSGQs. Extensive experiments on real datasets Gowalla and Twitter show that our proposed methods substantially outperform the baseline algorithms under various system settings.},

Unfortunately, existing query authentication techniques either do not work for set-valued data or they lack data confidentiality. In this paper, we propose authenticated aggregate queries over set-valued data that not only ensure the integrity of query results but also preserve the confidentiality of source data. As many aggregate queries are composed of multiset operations such as set union and subset, we first develop a family of privacy-preserving authentication protocols for primitive multiset operations. Using these protocols as building blocks, we present a privacy-preserving authentication framework for various aggregate queries and further optimize their authentication performance. Security analysis and empirical evaluation show that our proposed privacy-preserving authentication techniques are feasible and robust under a wide range of system workloads.},

    abstract = {With the recent success of cryptocurrency, Blockchain's design opens the door of building trustworthy distributed systems. A common paradigm is to repurpose the Blockchain as an append-only log that logs the application events in time order for subsequent auditing and query verification. While this paradigm reaps the security benefit, it faces technical challenges especially when being used for data-intensive applications. Instead of treating Blockchain as a time-ordered log, we propose to lay the log-structured merge tree (LSM tree) over the Blockchain for efficient and lightweight logging. Comparing other data structures, the LSM tree is advantageous in supporting efficient writes while enabling random-access reads. In our system design, only a small digest of an LSM tree is persisted in the Blockchain and minimal store operations are carried out by smart contracts. With the implementation in Ethereum/Solidity, we evaluate the proposed logging scheme and demonstrate its performance efficiency and effectiveness in cost saving.},

    abstract = {Query authentication has been extensively studied to ensure the integrity of query results for outsourced databases, which are often not fully trusted. However, access control, another important security feature, is largely ignored by existing works. Notably, recent breakthroughs in cryptography have enabled fine-grained access control over outsourced data. In this paper, we take the first step toward studying the problem of authenticating relational queries with fine-grained access control. The key challenge is how to protect information confidentiality during query authentication, which is essential to many critical applications. To address this challenge, we propose a novel access-policy-preserving (APP) signature as the primitive authenticated data structure. A useful property of the APP signature is that it can be used to derive customized signatures for unauthorized users to prove the inaccessibility while achieving the zero-knowledge confidentiality. We also propose a grid-index-based tree structure that can aggregate APP signatures for efficient range and join query authentication. In addition to this, a number of optimization techniques are proposed to further improve the authentication performance.  Security analysis and performance evaluation show that the proposed solutions and techniques are robust and efficient under various system settings.},

In the data outsourcing scenario, result integrity must be ensured by means of a query authentication scheme. However, most of the existing studies are confined to a centralized environment. In this paper, we investigate the query authentication problem in distributed environments and focus on the $k$ nearest neighbor (kNN) query, which is widely used in spatial data analytics. We design a new distributed spatial authenticated data structure (ADS), distributed MR-tree, to facilitate efficient kNN processing. Furthermore, we propose a basic algorithm to process authenticated kNN queries based on the new ADS. Apart from the results, some verification objects are generated to guarantee the results' integrity. We also design two optimized algorithms to reduce the size of verification objects as well as the verification cost. Our experiments validate the good performance of the proposed techniques in terms of query cost, communication overhead, and verification time.},

    abstract = {Blockchains have recently been under the spotlight due to the boom of cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications. There is an increasing demand for querying the data stored in a blockchain database. To ensure query integrity, the user can maintain the entire blockchain database and query the data locally. However, this approach is not economic, if not infeasible, because of the blockchain's huge data size and considerable maintenance costs. In this paper, we take the first step toward investigating the problem of verifiable query processing over blockchain databases. We propose a novel framework, called vChain, that alleviates the storage and computing costs of the user and employs verifiable queries to guarantee the results' integrity. To support verifiable Boolean range queries, we propose an accumulator-based authenticated data structure that enables dynamic aggregation over arbitrary query attributes. Two new indexes are further developed to aggregate intra-block and inter-block data records for efficient query verification. We also propose an inverted prefix tree structure to accelerate the processing of a large number of subscription queries simultaneously. Security analysis and empirical study validate the robustness and practicality of the proposed techniques.},

In this demonstration, we present a system called vABS, which enables verifiable Attribute-Based Search over shared cloud data. The vABS system adopts the common DaaS architecture, in which the server provides search services to users on behalf of data owners. By employing a novel zero-knowledge approach proposed in our prior work, vABS not only provides users with good search experiences, but also supports authenticated query processing with fine-grained access control, which is crucial to many high-security applications.},

    abstract = {With the explosive growth of online images and the popularity of search engines, a great demand has arisen for small and medium-sized enterprises to build and outsource large-scale image retrieval systems to cloud platforms. While reducing storage and retrieval burdens, enterprises are at risk of facing untrusted cloud service providers. In this paper, we take the first step in studying the problem of query authentication for large-scale image retrieval. Due to the large size of image files, the main challenges are to (i) design efficient authenticated data structures (ADSs) and (ii) balance search, communication, and verification complexities. To address these challenges, we propose two novel ADSs, the Merkle randomized k-d tree and the Merkle inverted index with cuckoo filters, to ensure the integrity of query results in each step of image retrieval. For each ADS, we develop corresponding search and verification algorithms on the basis of a series of systemic design strategies. Furthermore, we put together the ADSs and algorithms to design the final authentication scheme for image retrieval, which we name ImageProof. We also propose several optimization techniques to improve the performance of the proposed ImageProof scheme. Security analysis and extensive experiments are performed to show the robustness and efficiency of ImageProof.},

    abstract = {Blockchain technology has attracted much attention due to the great success of the cryptocurrencies. Owing to its immutability property and consensus protocol, blockchain offers a new solution for trusted storage and computation services. To scale up the services, prior research has suggested a hybrid storage architecture, where only small meta-data are stored on-chain and the raw data are outsourced to off-chain storage. To protect data integrity, a cryptographic proof can be constructed online for queries over the data stored in the system. However, the previous schemes only support simple key-value queries. In this paper, we take the first step toward studying authenticated range queries in the hybrid-storage blockchain. The key challenge lies in how to design an authenticated data structure (ADS) that can be efficiently maintained by the blockchain, in which a unique \emph{gas} cost model is employed. By analyzing the performance of the existing techniques, we propose a novel ADS, called {GEM$^2$-tree}, which is not only gas-efficient but also effective in supporting authenticated queries. To further reduce the ADS maintenance cost without sacrificing much the query performance, we also propose an optimized structure, {GEM$^{2*}$-tree}, by designing a two-level index structure. Theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation validate the performance of the proposed ADSs.},

Given the data-intensive feeds in real life (e.g.,~high-frequency price updates) and the high cost in using blockchain, namely Gas, it is imperative to reduce the Gas cost of data feeds. Motivated by the constant-changing workloads in finance and other applications, this work focuses on designing a \emph{dynamic, workload-aware} approach for cost effectiveness in Gas. This design space is understudied in the existing blockchain research which has so far focused on static data placement. \par This work presents GRuB, a cost-effective data feed that dynamically replicates data between the blockchain and an off-chain cloud storage. GRuB's data replication is workload-adaptive by monitoring the current workload and making online decisions w.r.t.~data replication. A series of online algorithms are proposed that achieves the bounded worst-case cost in blockchain's Gas. GRuB runs the decision-making components on the untrusted cloud off-chain for lower Gas costs, and employs a security protocol to authenticate the data transferred between the blockchain and cloud. The overall GRuB system can autonomously achieve low Gas costs with changing workloads. \par We built a GRuB prototype functional with Ethereum and Google LevelDB, and supported real applications in stablecoins. Under real workloads collected from the Ethereum contract-call history and mixed workloads of YCSB, we systematically evaluate GRuB's cost which shows a saving of Gas by 10\% \~{} 74\%, with comparison to the baselines of static data-placement.},

To scale blockchain systems, a prevailing approach is to employ a hybrid storage model, where only small meta-data are stored on-chain while the raw data are outsourced to an off-chain storage service provider. The key issue for query processing in such a system is the design of \emph{gas}-efficient authenticated data structure (ADS) to authenticate the query results. In this paper, we study novel ADS schemes for authenticated keyword search in hybrid-storage blockchains. We first propose the suppressed Merkle inverted (Merkle$^{inv}$) index, which maintains only a partial ADS structure on-chain that can be securely updated with a logarithm-sized cryptographic proof. Moreover, we propose a Chameleon inverted (Chameleon$^{inv}$) index that leverages the chameleon vector commitment to achieve a constant maintenance cost. It is further optimized with Bloom filters to enhance the query and verification performance. We prove the security of the proposed ADS schemes and evaluate their performance using real datasets on the Ethereum platform. Experimental results show that, compared to a baseline solution, the proposed Merkle$^{inv}$ and Chameleon$^{inv}$ indexes reduce the average on-chain maintenance cost from US\$11.21 down to US\$2.69 and US\$0.24, respectively, without sacrificing much the query performance.},

    abstract = {The eruption of a pandemic, such as COVID-19, can cause an unprecedented global crisis. Contact tracing, as a pillar of communicable disease control in public health for decades, has shown its effectiveness on pandemic control. Despite intensive research on contact tracing, existing schemes are vulnerable to attacks and can hardly simultaneously meet the requirements of data integrity and user privacy. The design of a privacy-preserving contact tracing framework to ensure the integrity of the tracing procedure has not been sufficiently studied and remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose {P\textsuperscript{2}B-Trace}, a privacy-preserving contact tracing initiative based on blockchain. First, we design a decentralized architecture with blockchain to record an authenticated data structure of the user's contact records, which prevents the user from intentionally modifying his local records afterward. Second, we develop a zero-knowledge proximity verification scheme to further verify the user's proximity claim while protecting user privacy. We implement {P\textsuperscript{2}B-Trace} and conduct experiments to evaluate the cost of privacy-preserving tracing integrity verification. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed system.},

    abstract = {Blockchain technology has emerged as the cornerstone of many decentralized applications operating among otherwise untrusted peers. However, it is well known that existing blockchain systems do not scale well. Transactions are often executed and committed sequentially in order to maintain the same view of the total order. Furthermore, it is necessary to duplicate both transaction data and their executions in every node in the blockchain network for integrity assurance. Such storage and computation requirements put significant burdens on the blockchain system, not only limiting system scalability but also undermining system security and robustness by making the network more centralized. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we propose SlimChain, a novel blockchain system that scales transactions through off-chain storage and parallel processing. Advocating a stateless design, SlimChain maintains only the short commitments of ledger states on-chain while dedicating transaction executions and data storage to off-chain nodes. To realize SlimChain, we propose new schemes for off-chain smart contract execution, on-chain transaction validation, and state commitment. We also propose optimizations to reduce network transmissions and a new sharding technique to improve system scalability further. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed SlimChain system. Compared with the existing systems, SlimChain reduces the on-chain storage requirements by 97\% \textasciitilde~99\%, while also improving the peak throughput by 1.4X \textasciitilde~15.6X.},

    abstract = {Blockchain has recently gained massive attention thanks to the success of cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications. With immutability and tamper-resistance features, it can be seen as a promising secure database solution. To address the need of searches over blockchain databases, prior work vChain proposed a novel verifiable processing framework that ensures query integrity without maintaining a full copy of the blockchain database. It however suffers from several limitations, including linear-scan search performance in the worst case and impractical public key management. In this paper, we propose a new searchable blockchain system, vChain+, that supports efficient verifiable boolean range queries with additional features. Specifically, we propose a sliding window accumulator index to achieve efficient query processing even for the worst case. We also design an object registration index to enable practical public key management without compromising the security guarantee. To support richer queries, we employ optimal tree-based indexes to index both keywords and numerical attributes of the data objects. Several optimizations are also proposed to further improve the query performance. Security analysis and empirical study validate the robustness and performance improvement of the proposed system. Compared with vChain, vChain+ improves the query performance by up to 913X.},

    abstract = {In many applications, an organization may want to acquire data from many data owners. Facilities like data marketplaces allow data owners to produce data assemblage needed by data buyers through coalition. To encourage coalitions to produce data, it is critical to allocate revenue to data owners in a fair manner according to their contributions. Although in literature Shapley fairness and alternatives have been well explored to facilitate revenue allocation in data assemblage, computing exact Shapley value for many data owners and large assembled data sets through coalition remains challenging due to the combinatoric nature of Shapley value. In this paper, we explore the decomposability of utility in data assemblage by formulating the independent utility assumption. We argue that independent utility enjoys many applications. Moreover, we identify interesting properties of independent utility and develop fast computation techniques for exact Shapley value under independent utility. Our experimental results on a series of benchmark data sets show that our new approach not only guarantees the exactness of Shapley value, but also achieves faster computation by orders of magnitudes.},

    abstract = {Light clients have been widely used in blockchain systems to support lightweight nodes by synchronizing and verifying block headers only. However, there are two major limitations with the current light client design. First, with the ever increasing blockchain size, the cost for light clients to process and store all the block headers would soon become prohibitively high. Second, only simple queries can be supported by light clients due to the limited functionality of block headers. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose DCert, a novel decentralized certification framework, to enable \emph{superlight} clients with \emph{constant} storage and state validation costs. The main idea is to leverage a trusted enclave (e.g., Intel SGX) to recursively certify the entire history of the blockchain. With DCert, the blockchain integrity can be easily validated by superlight clients with a secure certificate. Furthermore, to support rich verifiable queries on light clients, DCert can be extended to certify authenticated indexes for different types of queries on an as-needed basis. While DCert is compatible with existing blockchain systems, its security is guaranteed by the trusted enclave. Our benchmark-based empirical study shows that DCert incurs a small certification overhead, yet it is capable of supporting efficient verifiable queries with a constant storage size of 2.97 KB and a constant bootstrapping time of 0.14 ms.},

    abstract = {Blockchain systems suffer from high storage costs as every node needs to store and maintain the entire blockchain data. After investigating Ethereum's storage, we find that the storage cost mostly comes from the index, i.e., Merkle Patricia Trie (MPT). To support provenance queries, MPT persists the index nodes during the data update, which adds too much storage overhead. To reduce the storage size, an initial idea is to leverage the emerging learned index technique, which has been shown to have a smaller index size and more efficient query performance. However, directly applying it to the blockchain storage results in even higher overhead owing to the requirement of persisting index nodes and the learned index's large node size. To tackle this, we propose COLE, a novel column-based learned storage for blockchain systems. We follow the column-based database design to contiguously store each state's historical values, which are indexed by learned models to facilitate efficient data retrieval and provenance queries. We develop a series of write-optimized strategies to realize COLE in disk environments. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed COLE system. Compared with MPT, COLE reduces the storage size by up to 94\% while improving the system throughput by $1.4\times$--$5.4\times$.},

    abstract = {The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi), Web 3.0, and other blockchain-based applications has led to an increased demand for on-chain data analysis across multiple blockchains. Conducting advanced queries, such as data aggregation and correlation analysis, is essential for gaining valuable insights in this context. However, multi-chain queries pose several challenges for the querying system, including compatibility with existing blockchains, supporting diverse query types, and ensuring the integrity of query results. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel paradigm called \emph{verifiable virtual filesystem} (V\textsuperscript{2}FS). V\textsuperscript{2}FS extends the POSIX I/O interface, shifting the focus from verifying computation to verifying data. This innovative approach empowers query clients to leverage an off-the-shelf database engine to evaluate queries using verifiable data retrieved from an indexing service provider (ISP). Our solution ensures strong integrity guarantees and can be smoothly integrated with existing database engines to support various query types. To achieve blockchain compatibility, we utilize the DCert framework to certify blocks from different blockchains, making our system applicable to various blockchain systems. Furthermore, we propose cache-based algorithms and a bloom filter-integrated algorithm to optimize query performance and minimize network communication costs. Security analysis and empirical study validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed system.},

    abstract = {Nearest neighbor search is a fundamental task in various domains, such as federated learning, data mining, information retrieval, and biomedicine. With the increasing need to utilize data from different organizations while respecting privacy regulations, private data federation has emerged as a promising solution. However, it is costly to directly apply existing approaches to federated k-nearest neighbor (kNN) search with difficult-to-compute distance functions, like graph or sequence similarity. To address this challenge, we propose FedKNN, a system that supports secure federated kNN search queries with a wide range of similarity measurements. Our system is equipped with a new Distribution-Aware kNN (DANN) algorithm to minimize unnecessary local computations while protecting data privacy. We further develop DANN*, a secure version of DANN that satisfies differential obliviousness. Extensive evaluations show that FedKNN outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, achieving up to 4.8$\times$ improvement on federated graph kNN search and up to 2.7$\times$ improvement on federated sequence kNN search. Additionally, our approach offers a trade-off between privacy and efficiency, providing strong privacy guarantees with minimal overhead.},

Moreover, we make an insightful observation that the Shapley values can be computed using subsets of minimal syntheses within the inclusion-exclusion framework in combinatorics. Based on this insight, we develop a game decomposition approach and utilize techniques in Boolean function decomposition into disjunctive normal form. One interesting property of our method is that the time complexity depends only on the data owners participating in those minimal syntheses, rather than all the data owners. Extensive experiments with real data sets demonstrate a significant efficiency improvement for computing the Shapley values in data assemblage tasks modeled as simple games.},
